# 📦 Image and Text Search Engine with VGG16, Elasticsearch, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Logstash

This project is a high-performance **image and text search engine** leveraging **deep learning** and modern search technology. It uses the **VGG16** model for feature extraction from images and **Elasticsearch** for fast indexing and retrieval of data. A seamless backend API is provided with **FastAPI**, a user-friendly frontend interface with **Streamlit**, and **Logstash** is used for efficient data ingestion.

## 📂 **Project Architecture**


## 🚀 **How It Works**

### 1. **VGG16 Feature Extraction**  
- Uses the **VGG16 deep learning model** to extract high-level **feature vectors** from uploaded images.  
- These vectors represent images in a meaningful way, capturing important features like texture, color, and shape.

### 2. **Elasticsearch Integration**  
- Indexes both **image features and textual data** using **Elasticsearch**, ensuring **fast and accurate** search results with similarity matching. 

### 3. **FastAPI Backend**  
- Provides a **RESTful API** using **FastAPI** for handling search requests.  
- Users can query by **text** or **images** and receive relevant results from Elasticsearch.

### 4. **Streamlit Web Interface**  
- **Streamlit** provides an intuitive **web interface**, enabling users to upload images, enter search queries, and explore the results. 

### 5. **Logstash Data Ingestion**  
- **Logstash** automates the ingestion of **CSV files** and other structured data into Elasticsearch, streamlining the search process with up-to-date indexes.

## 📂 **Folder Structure**

**Backend**

The Backend directory contains the core components of the backend service, responsible for data ingestion, feature extraction, and API routing.


```
├── backend.config.py        # Configuration settings for the backend service
├── ingest_data_elastic.py   # Script to ingest data into Elasticsearch
├── feature_extractor.py      # Module for extracting features from the ingested data
├── route.py                  # Defines the API routes and endpoints for the backend service
├── utils.py                  # Utility functions for processing data, including image and text searches in Elasticsearch               
```
**Frontend**

The Frontend directory includes the Streamlit application for user interaction.

```
├── app.py                    # Main entry point for the Streamlit frontend application
